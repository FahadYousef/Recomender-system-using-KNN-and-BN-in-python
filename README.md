# Recomender-system-using-KNN-and-BN-in-python
 In this repository, two datasets have been used. One data set used by K-nearest neighbor (KNN) in two methods, 
 and the other used by Bayesian network (BN). So in total, there are three different implementations of the recommender system. 
 All of these implementations applied in python 3.6.
